# FanRows – Digital Art Project

FanRows is a digital art project exploring how body movement can shape sound, interaction, and immersive creative experiences.  
This repository contains general information about the concept, vision, and artistic direction of the project.

## About FanRows
FanRows investigates how movement can serve as a creative medium.  
Using motion tracking and layered sound design, the project creates a space where physical expression becomes an active part of digital art.

The goal is not traditional performance, but exploration — discovering how subtle gestures, posture, and motion flow can influence evolving soundscapes and interactive atmospheres.

## Creative Concept
FanRows combines:
- **Embodied interaction** – the body as a dynamic interface  
- **Sound layering** – evolving textures and ambient structures  
- **Digital art principles** – presence, resonance, and experiential design  
- **Motion-driven transformation** – states that shift in response to movement

The project aims to bridge physical sensation and digital expression, creating an experience that is intuitive, responsive, and personally meaningful.

## Inspiration
FanRows draws from:
- contemporary dance and expressive movement  
- interactive and new media art  
- experimental sound design  
- creative coding and real-time visual/sound systems  

It explores how technology can support new forms of artistic presence, without replacing human intention or creativity.
